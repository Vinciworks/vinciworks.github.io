            <h1>CYBER ATTACK</h1>
            <p>
              Cyber-attack can be driven by the attacker’s intent on financial gain but can also target individuals,
              organizations, and governments as an act of hostility and to attack the regular functioning of such
              entities. This could be for political purposes or even purely for the fun of it. In today’s world, wars
              are not only fought on the physical battlefield, but also in cyber space and can cripple our
              day-to-day operations, both privately and publicly. Compromises to cyber security can result in
              criminals or hackers obtaining sensitive information, funds and committing identity theft.
